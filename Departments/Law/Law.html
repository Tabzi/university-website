 <h2>Department of Law</h2>

 <p style="margin-right: 20%;">Education is the foundation of knowledge and knowledg
    e is light which shuns the darkness of ignorance. Legal education is also a vital part of 
    that phenomenon as through this type of education also a civilized and organized society comes into
     existence. Legal education is still very popular and bound to become so with job opportunities of law perso
     ns increasing consequent upon economic liberalization and globalization of legal services. However the present organ
     ization of legal education is not able to cater to the needs and demands which are changing from time to time. With this 
     end in view the University of
     Karachi has established its School of Law with the following aims and objectives.

 <h2>Department of Engineering</h2>

 <p style="margin-right: 20%;">Chemical Engineering arose from the need to 
    apply physical, chemical, and engineering principles to the processing of such varied products
     such as fuels, drugs, foods, plastics, metals ,microelectronics, and basic chemicals. Undergraduate prepa
     ration for this field is therefore especially broad and balanced, drawing on chemistry, mathematics, physics etc. 
     The graduates of a chemical engineering program are well prepared not only for industrial practice but also for graduate 
     ork in such diverse fields as biochemical, biomedical,or nuclear engineering; chemistry; environmental or energy studies; mat
     erials science; semiconductors, medicine; business administration; and law. Indeed, we seek to educate the future leaders of o
     ur technological society. Many chemical Engineers serve in the traditional chemical process industries of petroleum, natur
     al gas, chemicals, paper, and plastics. Some develop new 
     products or through research, while others carry out the pilot studies and 
     design work to bring innovations from the laboratory into manufacturing operations
     . Many are engaged in the operation and management of process plants. Others are in marketin
     g, developing new applications for, or solving problems arising from, the use of these products. Of
     ten a chemical engineer moves from one of these functions to the next as an idea develops-into a full-sca
     le production facility. Chemical engineers have long aided in energy and materials production from oil, gas, coal, an
     d high-energy chemicals. They are involved in the research, development, and production of energy from alternative energy reso
     urces. A chemical engineer's career path is varied and rewarding, allowi
    ng individual talents to grow and be fully utilized.

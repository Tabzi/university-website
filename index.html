    <p style="margin-right: 20%;">At the time of establishment of Pakistan as a sovereign state in 1947, the means for higher education and re
        search were negligible and diminished in the country. Responding to the impending requirement of higher learning, Pakistan Government started estab
        lishing educational institutions of higher learning and research and thus underwent rapid modernization under a policy guided by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan.
         Its first Vice-chancellor was Dr. ABA Haleem. In 1953 it started its teaching and research activities at t
        wo faculties: the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Science.
<br>
        For the first two years, the University of Karachi remained as an examination university for 
        the affiliated colleges. Over the years, the enrollment expanded rapidly. Karachi University first intake was 50 students, the un
        iversity now has 53 academic departments and 20 Research Centers and Institutes, under faculties of Social Sciences, Science, Islamic Studies, En
